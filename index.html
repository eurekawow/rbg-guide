    <h1 id="h.fbvx55owagyg"><span>Introduction</span></h1>
    <p><span>Welcome to the PvP aspect of WoW! As I tell everyone else, PvP is about </span><span>communication and team synergy</span><span>. </span><span>You are as strong as your weakest link</span><span>. This is not the same as PVE in which you fight an NPC and expect everything to happen in a given order without any confounding variables. PvP is </span><span>scenario based</span><span>, and you as a player must adapt to sudden changes. PvP is fast paced and requires </span><span>individual skill</span><span>. This is typically obtained through </span><span>knowledge of your class and specialization along with the accompanying knowledge of everything else </span><span>such as how to play objectively.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>Practice. Practice. Practice.</span><span>&nbsp;Just like with anything, from gaming to real life scenarios, practice is what will help you strive in the PvP aspect of WoW. You must learn your strengths and weaknesses. </span><span>Battlegrounds, Arena Skirmishes, and Wargames</span><span>. These are some of the few things that can get you started with PvP without the pressure and intensity of rated battlegrounds or arenas. Get a group of people together, </span><span>join Discord</span><span>, and see what you guys are capable of! If you lose a lot, just learn from it! You are still building up synergy either way!</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>Thick skin</span><span>. You can not be easily offended by your peers&rsquo; </span><span>constructive criticism</span><span>. There are people on this game that may have more experience than you but their attitude may not be the friendliest. Do not take the criticism too harshly, </span><span>learn from it</span><span>. We all project our feelings differently, some more aggressively than others. There will be several disagreements in PvP due to different perspectives and different scenarios that not every player may be aware of during intense games. Take the time to hear someone out thoroughly before responding. </span><span>Think before you speak or act.</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span>Communication</span><span>&nbsp;is crucial in PvP. In order to be successful in PvP, you must coordinate with the other members in your group. To be able to land a kill does not necessarily mean you all target the same person and just smash your buttons. You need to be able to use your abilities on their healers and take them out of the fight momentarily so that your target dies due to lack of aid from their team. This is accomplished through the use of crowd control (CC) abilities (i Cyclones, Mind Control, Fear, Freezing Trap, etc). Everyone on Discord should already have a microphone, therefore be prepared to use it. There will be times where the call gets frantic because numerous people are talking at once. This is normal. Although, you should ensure that the leader&rsquo;s voice is authoritative and clear so the group is able to follow through if there is a sudden change in the strategy. You must also respect the voice of your Target Caller (TC) because being on the same target as everyone else can help secure a kill more effectively.</span></p>
    <p></p>

Some of the information provided in this guide may not be present in higher MMR groups or they may be presented in a more advanced form.

    <h2 id="h.ptxtm4xmptkf"><span>PvP Gear</span></h2>
    <p><span>As of Shadowlands patch 9.0, Blizzard has implemented </span><span>PvP vendors</span><span>&nbsp;back into the game! You may now buy PvP gear using honor and/or conquest gained from PvP content. This includes anything from PvP weekly quests, random battlegrounds or arena skirmishes, and any ranked matches. You may earn a </span><span>maximum</span><span>&nbsp;of 550 conquest per week. If you do not reach the cap, it will roll over to the following week. The baseline ilvl for </span><span>honor gear</span><span>&nbsp;is </span><span>158 ilvl</span><span>&nbsp;and the baseline ilvl for </span><span>conquest gear</span><span>&nbsp;is </span><span>200 ilvl</span><span>. However, depending on your renown level and PvP rank, you may upgrade the gear further using honor, for </span><span>both</span><span>&nbsp;gear types.</span></p>

      <li><span>Floating:</span><span>&nbsp;Floating refers to a player&rsquo;s positioning when they are between bases and not engaged in the teamfight.

      <li><span>Ghosting:</span><span>&nbsp;Ghosting refers to a player that intentionally leaves the base that they are defending and leaves it vulnerable to enemies who can potentially capture it. </span><span>When a player is ghosting, that player should alert their team members!</span></li>
      <li><span>Juking:</span><span>&nbsp;Juking refers to the action of a player faking their cast (i casts a spell and then cancels it) in order to bait an interrupt out of the enemy player. This is usually done so that once the kick/interrupt is used, the healer can freely cast and heal.</span></li>
      <li><span>Padding:</span><span>&nbsp;Padding is when a player&rsquo;s main focus is numbers rather than objectives (i trying to top dps meters but never really helping execute a kill)</span></li>

      <li><span>Spinning:</span><span>&nbsp;Spinning is when players are attacking the people around a base flag so that they are unable to capture it.</span></li>
      <li><span>Split Rez: </span><span>A split rez refers to the situation in which the opposing team is forced to wait for everyone to rez in order to regroup. (in RBGs, every time you die, you will </span><span>always</span><span>&nbsp;get a 25 second rez timer)</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense:</span><span>&nbsp;Offense refers to the team that is pushing towards the enemy team/base.</span></li>

    <ul>
      <li><span>Buy drinks to restore mana in RBGs</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You need this specific drink (besides mage food) because; it is the only drink you can use in RBGs (</span><span>Ambroria Dew)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Oribos Innkeeper</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>I tested </span><span>Ethereal Pomegranate </span><span>and it does not work in RBGs.<br></span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>ALWAYS loot players&rsquo; insignias/bodies</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you do not loot insignias/bodies, players can run to their bodies and body rez, bypassing the 25 second timer and returning to a node/team fight earlier</span></li>
      <li><span>If the enemy team body rezzes near a base, it could be dangerous because they are in a good position to attempt another ninja on a base again spin a node they have</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>This is critical, especially if your base sitter has already used their trinket and CDs on the enemy team&rsquo;s first attempt to take the base<br></span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If your insignia/body is NOT taken, make sure to take advantage of a body rez if needed</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Sometimes you can wait until the last person dies to take the rez and prolong the spinning of the base/flag, buying your team more time to either reinforce or pull ahead in point resources</span></li>
      <li><span>Sometimes you can body rez after a huge teamfight and when they leave a solo base sitter, you can attempt a CC cap </span><span>(usually only in low MMR games)<br></span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>ALWAYS be clicking your BattlegroundEnemies add-on AND tracking the enemy team</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Sometimes in low MMR RBGs, you do not need to send multiple people to a base because they either ignore the base or send very few people. By keeping track of the enemy team, you can allocate your players elsewhere.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Everyone is responsible for everything</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>While in the midst of team fights, build a habit of periodically glancing at the flag and keeping an eye on it so you can spin it just in case the enemy team starts capping (</span><span>NOTE: </span><span>Remember that some classes are AoE capped now)</span></li>
      <li><span>Always make sure the all enemy players are accounted for; sometimes players peel out during a chaotic team fight to take another base<br></span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Utilize trinket swapping</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Unlike rated arenas, you are able to swap trinkets during an RBG</span></li>
      <li><span>If your </span><span>Medallion</span><span>&nbsp;is on CD, you can swap it out for the </span><span>Relentless</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Brooch/Adaptation</span><span>&nbsp;trinket until it is off CD (</span><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;You are </span><span>not</span><span>&nbsp;penalized by a 30 second downtime since the </span><span>Relentless Brooch/Adaptation </span><span>is not an on-use trinket)</span></li>

    <h1 id="h.igtzy8ezi1m"><span>RBG Meta</span></h1>
    <h2 id="h.i2xlv1b7xwor"><span>Healers</span></h2>
    <p><span>The current meta healing comp for RBGs consists of healers capable of keeping up with the fast paced damage output. Most groups are typically seen bringing </span><span>2 Disc Priests</span><span>&nbsp;for consistently high healing output and a </span><span>Resto Shaman</span><span>&nbsp;for utility and dispels. Some groups seem to substitute one of the Disc Priests for a Mistweaver (MW) or Hpally. It is the MW&rsquo;s responsibility to be the </span><span>flexible</span><span>&nbsp;healer; this means that they should always be ready to float towards bases on node maps and be ready to two heal offense </span><span>(explained later)</span><span>&nbsp;when necessary. MWs have the most </span><span>objective</span><span>&nbsp;responsibility. If you play this role, it is beneficial to have good awareness and a strong understanding of your class. If not a MW, it would be another designated healer&rsquo;s responsibility to peel out of fights and take the role of a MW.</span></p>
    <h2 id="h.ve1dm7cbf0b2"><span>DPS</span></h2>
    <p><span>The main dps every group looks for is a </span><span>rogue</span><span>. The current meta calls for a rogue for base sitting, FC kill setups, and utility. </span><span>(</span><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;In Shadowlands Season 1, rogues are seen doing high damage in their opener and bursts - thus some groups are taking </span><span>more</span><span>&nbsp;than one).</span><span>&nbsp;In addition to this dps and three healers, the remaining dps may vary. Group composition is not a huge deal, especially in lower MMR groups (</span><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;See below for group compositions). The most important determining factor is whether the player is familiar with </span><span>all</span><span>&nbsp;the tools and capabilities their class may perform. However, many groups have been seen running Boomkins, Marksman Hunters, and Arms Warriors, Affliction Locks, and Unholy DKs. </span></p>
    <p><span>If you bring one caster (i.e affliction lock), it is highly recommended to bring a second caster for two main reasons: (1) dot protection (explained later) and (2) preventing the one dps caster from being interrupted, CC&#39;ed, or focused. If a caster dps is focused (i shadow priest), their dps will be denied and the amount of damage they take will result in your healers cycling through their cooldowns quickly. There are only so many interrupts available at a given time, thus it is essential that you bring at least two casters if you decide to bring one.</span></p>
    <p><span>In addition, you ideally want to bring a dps that can base sit with the rogue. A good base sitter is defined by either their </span><span>survivability</span><span>&nbsp;or utility. Classes that have a pet are usually good for base sitting because it becomes harder to CC cap on them since there are essentially &ldquo;two&rdquo; people </span><span>(r</span><span>eview the base sitting portion of this guide)</span><span>. However, when facing a team with two or more stealth classes, be prepared to have your DH, or some sort of mobile dps, and possibly a healer, floating. This is especially crucial if both of the enemy team&rsquo;s players are stealthed at the same time and if there are other players </span><span>(aside from the original base sitters)</span><span>&nbsp;sitting the bases.</span></p>
    <h3 id="h.9t0hcmhqj6ov"><span>Caster Cleave - &ldquo;Rot Comp&rdquo;</span></h3>
    <p><span>A dps rot comp usually means that you primarily invite caster dps with dots. A rot comp is defined as a group that spreads raid wide damage to the enemy team. The damage is thus constant and forces the enemy team to dispel dots in order to stop or reduce the amount of damage. You would invite classes such as Boomkins, Shadow Priests, and Affliction Locks. </span></p>

    <p><span>A melee cleave is as the name itself states. A melee comp is defined as a group that primarily invites melee dps. This damage is thus single target based and extremely bursty. You would invite classes such as Arms Warriors, Death Knights (Frost or Unholy), Demon Hunters, Retribution Paladins, etc.</span></p>

    <h2 id="h.wv0n2vxtzibs"><span>Tank/FC</span></h2>
    <p><span>The only tanks needed for the current RBG meta is a Vengeance DH or Guardian Druid. Communicating with your team, especially your defense squad, is a crucial aspect of FCing. Guardian Druids are amazing with a defense team that can peel, knock, and kite with them as well. They are becoming increasingly popular and often preferred over DH tanks. Some groups have even been seen to run without a tank. Rather, groups have been seen to run 7 dps for </span><span>stronger</span><span>&nbsp;team fights and then have one their </span><span>boomkins</span><span>&nbsp;run the flag when seen fit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some groups, especially lower MMR groups, tend to bring a different type of tank (i Protection Paladin, Blood Death Knight, etc). These tanks are sometimes sufficient enough in lower XP/MMR games on FC maps because either teams do not push in with a full group or your offense is much quicker at killing their FC and the stacking debuff never gets too high. If you think your team may not be quick enough, I highly recommend prioritizing a Vengeance DH or Guardian Druid for FC. The other tanks can serve as a support (i Protection Paladins can use all utility on healers to get them out of CC and provide strong offheals, Protection Warriors can Intervene the FC/healers to reduce damage taken, Blood Death Knights can grip multiple targets off of the FC, spam Chains of Ice to slow dps and let the FC kite, etc).</span></p>

    <h2 id="h.6fm087vtxdb0"><span>Base Sitting Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>B</span><span>E VOCAL!</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If people are coming towards your base, you call incoming, and no one is responding, you </span><span>NEED</span><span>&nbsp;to be assertive and make sure your team </span><span>HEARS YOU AND RESPONDS</span><span>. Specify what is coming so your team knows whether to peel out a healer or dps to help you.</span></li>
      <li><span>Always use Medallion!</span><span>&nbsp;You need to be able to </span><span>control</span><span>&nbsp;what you are trinketing!</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Adaptation</span><span>&nbsp;will waste itself on a Sap or other CC you may not need to trinket.</span></li>
      <li><span>Relentless</span><span>&nbsp;leaves you vulnerable to CC chains if they send 2+ people</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Always</span><span>&nbsp;b</span><span>e checking your map and using your BGE add-on to call incs in advance. You should be able to see someone more than 10 seconds out that is coming to hit your base (with the exception of stealthies). If you call inc when they are at your base, you do not give your team enough time to react and rotate players accordingly, especially on a map like Deepwind Gorge.</span></li>
      <li><span>If there are </span><span>multiple stealthies </span><span>on the opposing team, you need to be aware and keep track of them at all times. If multiple people are stealthed, you need to be vocal and let your team know so you can either double sit or get ready to take a ghosted base (iif a rogue and boomy are both stealthed for a long period of time on a map like Gilneas, they may be setting up to double hit a node and ghost their base).</span></li>
      <li><span>DO NOT</span><span>&nbsp;stand directly on the flag. You should stand a distance from the flag, far enough to where you are unable to get sap capped.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>NEVER</span><span>&nbsp;trinket Sap! If you trinket a Sap, you will be put into a </span><span>full Kidney Shot or Blind</span><span>&nbsp;immediately after and still get capped on. This means you are too close to the flag and need to stand further back.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you do not have a trinket after an attempt is made to take your base, you must be </span><span>vocal </span><span>about it and make sure either someone else with their trinket available sits for you or someone double sits the base with you. The same thing applies to your CDs because they are vital to your survival and ability to stall the enemy while someone peels to your base.</span></li>

    <h2 id="h.musvxv690d9y"><span>Best Target Callers</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Rogue:</span><span>&nbsp;Rogues are by far one of the best classes to set up a kill because of their 6 second stun and their Smoke Bomb ability to attempt a guaranteed kill</span></li>
      <li><span>Warrior:</span><span>&nbsp;Warriors are by far one of the best TCs because of their mainly single target damage, MS and Sharpen Blade ability</span></li>
      <li><span>D</span><span>eath Knight:</span><span>&nbsp;A Death Knight&rsquo;s ability to grip a target into the team fight makes for effective hard swaps</span></li>
      <li><span>Hunter:</span><span>&nbsp;Hunters have high single target damage and they are able to run a pet with the MS ability</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;MM hunters lose 10% damage when they run a pet - Lone Wolf ability</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Demon Hunter:</span><span>&nbsp;Demon hunters have great single target and burst set up as well but they are usually the first dps to peel out of a teamfight or stop drinks</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.949mzxj6gbn"><span>Target Calling Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Be extremely </span><span>vocal and assertive</span><span>&nbsp;with your callouts! If people are not switching to your target, you need to keep calling out for them to switch because kills require coordination</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Your BGE add-on has a target counter on it so you can tell if people are listening</span></li>
      <li><span>Alternate targets depending on who has defensives CDs up and who does not</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Your TC should have some sort of </span><span>CD tracker</span><span>&nbsp;so that they can make effective swaps</span></li>
      <li><span>DPS Clothies </span><span>(those that need to hard cast) should be prioritized targets because they are the most vulnerable and susceptible to burst (i shadow priests, mages, warlocks) and they are unable to keep their damage numbers high</span></li>
      <li><span>Killing players that overextend into the backline of your team should be prioritized targets as well because they have to either fall back or force their healers to push up to heal them, resulting in multiple players out of position</span></li>
      <li><span>People have a </span><span>misconception</span><span>&nbsp;of simply trying to kill a healer all day. Yes it is possible to kill a healer initially but think of it this way...theoretically all three healers are at full mana and they have 6 other dps in the fight (excluding the one that is base sitting a captured node) who are able to peel you guys off with CCs, snares, and more. If the healers waste their CDs on dps, then they are more susceptible to burst and that is when you can hard switch to a healer and kill them</span></li>
      <li><span>When a healer is extremely low on mana, you </span><span>do not</span><span>&nbsp;want to kill them because when they die, they will come back to the teamfight with </span><span>full</span><span>&nbsp;mana. The best thing to do is to CC another healer (essentially putting two healers out of the fight), and either kill the other healer with mana or start to wipe the dps. As a TC, remind your team that when the healers try to peel out, one person should push up to keep them in combat and prevent them from drinkin</span><span>g</span></li>

    <h1 id="h.p91j3x2h6fw7"><span>RBG Leading - General Guidelines</span></h1>
    <h2 id="h.h0za2nx0f1i9"><span>Leadership Qualities</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Vocal:</span><span>&nbsp;A leader must be vocal and assertive so that their callouts can be heard during teamfights or frantic moments in the game. They should not be afraid to make callouts, especially if they are important and need to be followed up immediately<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Confidence:</span><span>&nbsp;Fake it until you make it. If you doubt your leadership and become frazzled in your decisions, your group will become just as frazzled because sometimes they (unfortunately) rely on you to make decisions and callouts.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Positive Attitude:</span><span>&nbsp;A positive attitude can take you farther than a negative one. Rather than yelling and getting mad for mistakes by your group members, (together) try to figure out what went wrong and what can be improved upon it.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Thick Skin:</span><span>&nbsp;A lot of backlash and criticism is aimed towards leaders of RBG groups because they are seen as &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for the outcomes of matches. Being able to maintain your composure and ignore trolls (by not feeding into them) can keep the momentum of the group going.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Maturity:</span><span>&nbsp;You need to be able to take criticism without taking it personally and understand that we are all playing a game to have fun. When you start yelling, it makes others yell back and it will not get anywhere.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Open-Mindedness:</span><span>&nbsp;Everyone experiences the point in where they feel like they know everything. Try avoiding this because even high rated players continue to learn new tricks and information. Be welcoming to information that may seem reasonably possible or try to explain to others why a particular idea will not work.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Dedication:</span><span>&nbsp;Leadership takes dedication because sometimes you may blame yourself for losses when in actuality they were not your fault. Be willing to learn from your own mistakes and continue to push forward.<br></span></li>
      <li><span>Responsibility:</span><span>&nbsp;A lot of inappropriate behavior or trolling may occur during queue sessions. If needed, you should be able to assume responsibility if one of your group members feels threatened or if a player needs to continue to improve individually before coming back into the rated scene. </span><span>Judgment calls.</span><span><br></span></li>
      <li><span>Patience:</span><span>&nbsp;A leader must expect to play with players that may need micromanaging or are not knowledgeable enough to make their own decisions. One must be prepared to deal with individuals that need additional help.</span></li>

    <ul>
      <li><span>There is a 25 minute timer, if it expires then whomever has the most captured flags wins</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>However is the score is tied, (i 1-1) whichever team captured the flag last, wins</span></li>
      <li><span>If neither team captures a flag for the entire 25 minute duration (0-0), the game ends in a </span><span>tie</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>To win the game without using up the entire time, your team must capture </span><span>three</span><span>&nbsp;flags</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>In order to interact with the flag, you must right click it</span></li>
      <li><span>To drop the flag, you must right click the buff (opposing faction-colored flag) off </span><span>OR</span><span>&nbsp;use the macro previously mentioned</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.chmjz3o48tpt"><span>RBG Strat</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>At the beginning of the match, have the FC go to the enemy flag room to pick up the enemy flag</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If the FC needs additional help picking up the flag, they should call for it and a mobile strong single target healer (usually the MW) should leave the team fight to help</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Pay attention</span><span>&nbsp;to the team fight, sometimes once your FC passes their team, several of the dps from the enemy team turn around in an attempt to kill your FC, especially if they outrange your healers</span></li>
      <li><span>Only have necessary players peel out of teamfight to help your FC</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you have a </span><span>Guardian Druid</span><span>, they can usually stealth in alone but everyone on the enemy team must be accounted for, especially their stealthies (i rouge/druids/mages/hunters)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You should also note that if they have a havoc DH on their team and you have a Guardian FC, they are going use Fel Sight try to pull your FC out of stealth; someone on your team should make sure to hit the DH to interrupt the ability</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Everyone else clashes into the enemy team and team fights</span></li>
      <li><span>When there is no team fight in mid, split into </span><span>5 man defense</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>5 man offense</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, two healers, and one dps that is capable of slowing or providing utility (i Hunter, DK, Ret, Spriest)</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the 3rd healer and the remaining dps</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>The MW (or any second healer) on defense should learn when to </span><span>push offense</span><span>&nbsp;in situations where you can</span><span>&nbsp;2 heal</span><span>&nbsp;your offensive push and be super aggressive; this can help guarantee a kill during that push</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>DO NOT</span><span>&nbsp;attempt this if your healer will not know when or how to peel back fast enough if the enemy team sends an offensive push</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Advanced:</span><span>&nbsp;4 man defense, 6 man offense</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You typically do this if you trust your defense team to hold their own and you need a stronger offensive push on the enemy FC</span></li>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, two healers, and one dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the 3rd healer and remaining dps</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Expert:</span><span>&nbsp;2-3 man defense, 7-8 man offense </span><span>(VERY SITUATIONAL - LAST MINUTE ATTEMPTS TO WIN GAME)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Teams typically do this when there is a few minutes left in the game and it is their last attempt to kill the enemy FC in order to secure a cap and win </span><span>(i the enemy team is on full defense and not pushing for your FC)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Sometimes the last dps on defense is sent for this push as well</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, one strong single target healer, and one dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense: </span><span>Should consist of 2 healers and the remaining dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;If you are desperate, you could theoretically send everyone but your FC (sometimes if this is done, the enemy team will send 1-2 dps to kill your FC if you are too slow to kill theirs)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Guardian FC Note:</span><span>&nbsp;Unlike a DH FC, you are unable to kite as quickly so your defense team should include strong heals and dps that can coordinate kills (classes with knock-offs or Mind Controls are a bonus)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.g8vx1l17o3f5"><span>Helpful Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>There are </span><span>speed</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>buffs within the tunnels of both the alliance and horde base</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>I personally make sure the speed buff is grabbed in the beginning once the game starts so the FC does not get a free speed boost</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Each side has a </span><span>berserker</span><span>&nbsp;hut and </span><span>leaf</span><span>&nbsp;hut</span></li>
      <li><span>Keep track of the EFC at all times</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Typically the EFC goes roof for more escape route options, knockbacks, and Mind Controls, but in lower MMR games, some FCs stand directly on the cap point or on the 2nd floor</span></li>
      <li><span>If the EFC is kiting around the base, you also want to be able to hit them from </span><span>two</span><span>&nbsp;directions rather than just trailing behind in a line</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Players need to be able to see where they are trying to kite and cut them off</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If the EFC is alone, sometimes they will wait for your team to commit to the ramp that leads towards the roof before dropping down and kiting to their GY for reinforcements</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Players need to be able to see this right away</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you have a </span><span>Havoc DH</span><span>&nbsp;on your team, they should be doing their best to control the enemy team&rsquo;s rogue and/or other stealthies to hinder their offense pushes</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Keeping track of when they rez, getting them out of stealth, etc</span></li>

    <h2 id="h.vnauppgz6h24"><span>Playing Objectively (capture the flag)</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>There is a 25 minute timer, if it expires then whomever has the most captured flags wins</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>However is the score is tied, (i 1-1) whichever team captured the flag last, wins</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>To win the game without using up the entire time, your team must capture </span><span>three</span><span>&nbsp;flags</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>In order to interact with the flag, you must right click it</span></li>
      <li><span>To drop the flag, you must right click the buff (opposing faction colored flag) off </span><span>OR</span><span>&nbsp;use the macro previously mentioned</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.o002divqgk2y"><span>RBG Strat</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>At the beginning of the match, have the FC go to the enemy flag room to pick up the enemy flag</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If the FC needs additional help picking up the flag, they should call for it and a mobile strong single target healer (usually the MW) should leave the team fight to help</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Pay attention</span><span>&nbsp;to the team fight, sometimes once your FC passes their team, several of the dps from the enemy team turn around in an attempt to kill your FC, especially if they outrange your healers</span></li>
      <li><span>Only have necessary players peel out of teamfight to help your FC</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you have a </span><span>Guardian Druid</span><span>, they can usually stealth in alone but everyone on the enemy team must be accounted for, especially their stealthies (i rouge/druids/mages/hunters)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You should also note that if they have a havoc DH on their team and you have a Guardian FC, they are going use Fel Sight try to pull your FC out of stealth; someone on your team should make sure to hit the DH to interrupt the ability</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Everyone else clashes into the enemy team and team fights</span></li>
      <li><span>When there is no team fight in mid, split into </span><span>5 man defense</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>5 man offense</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, two healers, and one dps that is capable of slowing or providing utility (i Hunter, DK, Ret, Spriest)</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the 3rd healer and the remaining dps</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>The MW (or any second healer) on defense should learn when to </span><span>push offense</span><span>&nbsp;in situations where you can</span><span>&nbsp;2 heal</span><span>&nbsp;your offensive push and be super aggressive; this can help guarantee a kill during that push</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>DO NOT</span><span>&nbsp;attempt this if your healer will not know when or how to peel back fast enough if the enemy team sends an offensive push</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Advanced:</span><span>&nbsp;4 man defense, 6 man offense</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You typically do this if you trust your defense team to hold their own and you need a stronger offensive push on the enemy FC</span></li>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, two healers, and one dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the 3rd healer and remaining dps</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Expert:</span><span>&nbsp;2-3 man defense, 7-8 man offense </span><span>(VERY SITUATIONAL - LAST MINUTE ATTEMPTS TO WIN GAME)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Teams typically do this when there is a few minutes left in the game and it is their last attempt to kill the enemy FC in order to secure a cap and win </span><span>(i the enemy team is on full defense and not pushing for your FC)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Sometimes the last dps on defense is sent for this push as well</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Defense:</span><span>&nbsp;Should consist of the FC, one strong single target healer, and one dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Offense: </span><span>Should consist of 2 healers and the remaining dps</span></li>
      <li><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;If you are desperate, you could theoretically send everyone but your FC (sometimes if this is done, the enemy team will send 1-2 dps to kill your FC if you are too slow to kill theirs)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Guardian FC Note:</span><span>&nbsp;Unlike a DH FC, you are unable to kite as quickly so your defense team should include strong heals and dps that can coordinate kills (classes with knock-offs or Mind Controls are a bonus)</span></li>

    <h2 id="h.kb6p9rc6hvmv"><span>RBG Strat</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>In the beginning:</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Typically your </span><span>offcart team</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(the team that is responsible for contesting the two carts that contain no major teamfight)</span><span>&nbsp;would be a </span><span>rogue</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>one</span><span>&nbsp;other dps that may not be as beneficial in the initial teamfight or has a strong 1v1 potential</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>The offcart teams typically contest the mid cart because it is </span><span>always</span><span>&nbsp;the first cart to be captured.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If your offcart team wins</span><span>&nbsp;it early, the more mobile dps should peel out and try to secure the top cart as well.</span></li>
      <li><span>If your offcart team seems to be on the losing end of the matchup, they should peel out and attempt to secure top to avoid losing both carts in the beginning.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If </span><span>both</span><span>&nbsp;the middle and top cart are lost, your team is already losing by </span><span>300+ points</span><span>. (This is assuming lava was captured in your favor. If it was not captured in your favor, then you already have a &nbsp;</span><span>450 point disadvantage</span><span>.)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If there is a </span><span>rogue</span><span>&nbsp;on the offcart team, let them do the </span><span>stuns</span><span>&nbsp;and set up kills. Their CC is vital when the matchup involves even numbers.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Everyone else that is not a part of the offcart team should head to the </span><span>lava cart</span><span>&nbsp;and attempt to keep the teamfight there.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Advanced:</span><span>&nbsp;Some teams choose to teamfight at lava with </span><span>all 10 players</span><span>&nbsp;if they have a strong teamfight in an attempt to quickly wipe the enemy team, put them on a split rez, and peel out to secure the offcarts.</span></li>
      <li><span>Additional Strat:</span><span>&nbsp;Some teams choose to send </span><span>8 players</span><span>&nbsp;to the mid cart, have one person contest the top cart in their favor, and have their </span><span>rogue</span><span>&nbsp;(or some stealthed class) </span><span>change the direction of the tracks</span><span>&nbsp;that the lava cart takes so it goes north instead of its normal route.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>This usually works best if you queue in as the Horde team because you are closer to the mid cart and get the initial tag. Although Alliance teams do still attempt this, especially if they have strong teamfights.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Throughout the rest of the match, you rotate players around as needed.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Always be aware of the ratio of teammates:enemies in the cart. This map is all about contesting the cart and keeping it in your favor. You </span><span>do not</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>want to overcommit to one cart and lose other ones.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>The top cart </span><span>should not</span><span>&nbsp;be a priority because the enemy team can position themselves to slow your entire team and put you at a disadvantage.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>However, if you see an opportunity to ninja it or potentially rush it and get a guaranteed cap, it could be the game changer.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.p1evs1etz9n0"><span>Helpful Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Remember that the </span><span>mid cart </span><span>always</span><span>&nbsp;caps </span><span>first</span><span>!</span></li>
      <li><span>You can change the direction of the tracks on the top cart and lava cart (not recommended unless you are trying to stop the team from getting quick points or trying to split them up)</span></li>
      <li><span>There are two </span><span>leaf </span><span>spots</span><span>&nbsp;and two </span><span>berserker</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>spots</span></li>

    <ul>
      <li><span>The first team to 1500 points wins</span></li>
      <li><span>Each death grants the other team 10 points</span></li>
      <li><span>Standing in the </span><span>middle</span><span>&nbsp;area with an orb grants 5 points per tick</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Note:</span><span>&nbsp;This is a different amount than in random BGs. In random BGs, you get more than 5 points per orb in middle; thus most groups just try to control middle</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Standing in the outer ring area with an orb grants 4 points per tick</span></li>
      <li><span>Standing in the area outside the map (GY areas) grants 3 points per tick</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.ap1s8rlsx4"><span>RBG Strat (resource based map)</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>At the beginning:</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>No one picks up an orb in the beginning, rather, play to wipe the enemy team and put them on an immediate split rez and then begin grabbing orbs</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Healers </span><span>should NEVER</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>grab the orbs, the </span><span>ONLY exception</span><span>&nbsp;is if the game is almost over and picking up that orb will help secure your victory </span><span>(i you need x amount of points, let&rsquo;s say less than 50, to win and the only person next to an orb is your healer)</span></li>
      <li><span>DHs and Boomkins should be prioritized as orb carriers because they have good survivability and mobility</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Otherwise, prioritize dps that have their defensives up </span><span>(i Disperse, Survival Instincts, etc)</span></li>
      <li><span>Caution: Some defensives do not work with the orb (i Aspect of the Turtle, Ice Block, Divine Shield, Blessing of Protection, etc)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>It is typically best to kite around the 4 point area than sitting in the middle because it is crucial that your team does not get put on a </span><span>split rez</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Disclaimer: </span><span>Some lower MMR groups are unable to keep up with the kiting strat and sometimes it is best to go mid</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you do decide to fight the other team in mid, spread out and rotate healing CDs accordingly</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.6pqxhk9k4pwf"><span>Helpful Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>I CANNOT stress this enough but the Random BG version of this map builds extremely </span><span>bad habits</span><span>&nbsp;since teams usually fight in the middle, no one ever really kites around with orbs, and you do not suffer the effects of what being on a split rez on this map feels like since everyone rezzes at the same time</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Whenever you get this map in RBGs, take a moment to step back and assess your gameplay (maybe stream or record it to watch it again later)</span></li>
      <li><span>Analyze what worked and what did not work for you team to prepare for the next time you get a queue for this map</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>There are two </span><span>berserker</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>spots (see map above)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>O</span><span>ne between the </span><span>orange</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>and </span><span>purple</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>orb</span></li>
      <li><span>One between the </span><span>blue</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>and </span><span>green</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>orb</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>There are four</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>leaf </span><span>spots (see map above)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>They are located both northern and southern entrances</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you hold </span><span>all four orbs</span><span>&nbsp;for approximately </span><span>50 seconds</span><span>, you will get a huge point increase and the orbs will tick for larger amounts</span></li>
      <li><span>DHs can double jump and Vengeful Retreat to get out of mid</span></li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>They can also be set up to cut across corners to help dps keep up with the enemy team if they decide to rotate/kite around the map with the orbs</span></li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you are going to die immediately after you pick up an orb, do not bother picking it up</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>You will feed the enemy team +10 points and put yourself on a split rez from the rest of your team; sometimes it is better to just let them pick it up, stay grouped, and wipe them as a group</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>HEALERS</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Try not to waste healing CDs on a player that has </span><span>high orb stacks </span><span>(200+ debuff)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Their healing received is reduced significantly and will die through most CDs; instead, save them for dps that are being offensive or orb carriers with </span><span>fresh</span><span>&nbsp;orb stacks</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Graveyards (see map above)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you are </span><span>alliance</span><span>, you rez at the </span><span>northern/top graveyards</span></li>
      <li><span>If you are </span><span>horde</span><span>, you rez at the </span><span>southern/bottom graveyards</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Which of the graveyards do you rez as when you die? (i left vs. right)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Imagine there is a line that cuts through the middle of the map, i</span><span>f you die on the right side of the line, you rez on the left side and vice versa</span><span><br></span></li>

    <ul>
      <li><span>The first team to 1500 points wins</span></li>
      <li><span>Each azerite node gives 100 points</span></li>
      <li><span>There is a 20 minute timer (if the timer expires, the team with the most amount of points wins - it is possible for this map to end in a </span><span>tie</span><span>)</span></li>
      <li><span>The </span><span>SAM</span><span>E 3</span><span>&nbsp;nodes always spawn in the beginning of the match and are often referred to as:</span></li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.dbv0ydm39r4u"><span>RBG Strat </span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>In the beginning:</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Split the raid into </span><span>three </span><span>separate groups (these are not necessarily </span><span>set</span><span>&nbsp;groups)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Sometimes dispersing the groups in terms of arena comps to win each node works because it prevents CC overlap and is more effective for kill setups</span></li>
      <li><span>Some teams like to send one healer and a tank to a node to spin it for as long as possible, allowing for more dps to be allocated to the other two nodes to win teamfights</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you are part of a spin team or do not think you will win the team fight at your particular node, you should focus on CCing the dps to peel and stop damage, off-healing your healer, and doing whatever else you can to stay alive as long as possible to buy the rest of your team more time to win their team fights and capture other nodes</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Focus CC on their burst (Avenging Wrath, Incarnation, etc), interrupt major abilities (Greater Pyroblast, Convoke the Spirits, Chaos Bolts, etc), and spin the node for as long as possible</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>ALWAYS COUNT</span><span>&nbsp;numbers, there may be an opportunity to overload a node or rotate players around</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Some teams will send all 3 of their healers to one node to make it seem like they are overloading it when in actuality they are sending their dps elsewhere to secure team fights</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If this happens, players should be able to rotate some dps out to the other nodes and try to secure the other team fights while the enemy team&rsquo;s healers are stuck at the one node</span></li>
      <li><span>The players that remain at the node should stop as much incoming damage as possible and keep the healers in combat, communicating if someone tries to peel out and/or stalling them for as long as possible</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Everyone</span><span>&nbsp;on this map needs to be </span><span>communicating</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Follow enemies and keep the teamfight where it needs to be, rotate players as needed</span></li>
      <li><span>Keep track of where their healers are, spin the nodes, call out if you notice the enemy team trying to rotate their players and if your node needs more help, etc</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h.ohm1ie3qmobu"><span>Helpful Tips</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>When there is an announcement about &ldquo;air supplies&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(you may only hear this if you have dialogue enabled ingame), either a </span><span>berserker</span><span>&nbsp;buff, a </span><span>leaf</span><span>, or a </span><span>Haste and CD Reset</span><span>&nbsp;buff</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>will spawn when the crate makes contact with the ground.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Berserker: </span></li>
      <li><span>Leaf: </span></li>
      <li><span>Haste and CD Reset:</span><span>&nbsp;Resets all CDs and grants 30% haste</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>When teamfighting at nodes, take note of any pillars or rocks that can be used as </span><span>LoS</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Healers should utilize them to negate as much damage or CC as possible in an attempt to live longer and give your team more time to reinforce the base or win the teamfight at other nodes</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>If you position your character properly when you dropping down from your ship, sometimes you are able to land on top of the pillars and ledges surrounding the nodes and be able to hit anyone in range of you</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>This is especially for </span><span>ranged classes </span><span>(that can spin a node from their position) </span><span>or MWs</span><span>&nbsp;(who can place their Transcendence up there and utilize it accordingly).</span></li>
      <li><span>DKs can Death Grip players down and Monks can knock players off with Ring of Peace.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>There is a mage on each team&rsquo;s ship that can conjure </span><span>mage food</span><span>. Look for your faction&rsquo;s NPC (listed below) and ask them to conjure up food. You may hold up to 80 (similar to that of a mage table).</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Alliance</span><span>: Rylai Crestfall</span></li>
      <li><span>Horde:</span><span>&nbsp;Jeron Emberfall</span></li>
